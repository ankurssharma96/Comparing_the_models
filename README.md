In this following project I have compared different Machine Learning Models on the provided data set each for regression and classification respectively.
What the Folders are about?

The Regression folder consists of:
1. Model Files 
2. Graph plots of the comparisions
3. The comparision tabels 
4. Ensembling methods used 
5. Feature Extraction method 

The Classification folder consists of:
1. Model Files 
2. The comparision tabels 
3. Ensembling methods used 
4. Feature Extraction method 


You can use the codes of several models and also the code to install the required packages and try to enhance the efficiency and the accuracy of the models.
